<p>Navigating from one route to another takes time in Angular. Perhaps a chunk must be lazy loaded or some data should
  be resolved. Here is an example of a simulated delay during routing and how this lib indicates this loading process to
  the user. Try it out :-)</p>
<button mat-stroked-button routerLink="/route-1">2 Seconds Loading delay</button>
<button mat-stroked-button routerLink="/route-2">5 Seconds Loading delay</button>

<kollers-loading-overlay></kollers-loading-overlay>
